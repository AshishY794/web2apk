**This tool can convert ANY web project to Android APK!** Here's what's supported:

### **✅ Supported Project Types:**

**🎨 Basic Web Projects:**
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript websites
- Static websites
- Landing pages
- Portfolio sites

**⚛️ Modern JavaScript Frameworks:**
- **React** - React apps, Create React App, Vite React
- **Vue.js** - Vue 2, Vue 3, Nuxt.js
- **Angular** - Angular 2+, Angular CLI projects
- **Svelte** - Svelte, SvelteKit

- Service worker enabled apps
- Offline-capable web apps

**🔧 Other Web Technologies:**
- Node.js web applications
- TypeScript projects
- Webpack/Vite built projects
- Any project that can run in a browser

### **🎯 How It Works:**

1. **Detects your project type** automatically
2. **Copies your entire project** (excluding node_modules, .git, etc.)
3. **Uses Capacitor** to wrap your web app
4. **Builds native Android APK** with your web content
5. **Your web app becomes a real Android app!**

## 🚀 Super Easy Setup (Choose Your Adventure!)

### 🎮 Adventure 1: Automatic Setup (Recommended for First Time!)

**Fully automated setup - everything happens automatically:**

#### **For VS Code Users:**

1. **Open VS Code**
2. **Open Terminal** (Ctrl+` or Terminal → New Terminal)
3. **Run these commands one by one:**

```bash
# Step 1: Download the magic box
git clone https://github.com/AshishY794/web2apk.git
cd web2apk

# Step 2: Install dependencies (IMPORTANT!)
npm install

# Step 3: Run the automated setup
npm run web2apk
```


### 🎮 Adventure 2: Manual Step-by-Step (Learn Everything!)

If you want to understand every step and do it manually, follow this guide:

#### **Step 1: Get the Magic Box** 📦
```bash
# This downloads the magic box to your computer
git clone https://github.com/AshishY794/web2apk.git
cd web2apk
```

**What this does:** Downloads all the tools you need to turn websites into apps!

#### **Step 2: Check Your GitHub Account** 🔐
```bash
# Check if you're logged in to GitHub
gh auth status

# If you see "Not logged in", then do this:
gh auth login
```

**What this does:** Makes sure you can use GitHub (like your account for storing code).

**If you get an error:** Don't worry! See the "Problems and Solutions" section below! 😊

#### **Step 3: Add Your Website** 🌐
Put your website files in the `www` folder:

```bash
# Copy your website files to the www folder
# Replace "/path/to/your/website" with where your website files are
cp -r /path/to/your/website/* www/
```

**What files you need:**
- 📄 `index.html` (required - this is your main page)
- 🎨 `style.css` (optional - makes it look pretty)
- ⚡ `script.js` (optional - makes it interactive)
- 🖼️ Any images, fonts, or other files

**Example of what goes in www folder:**
```
www/
├── index.html          ← Your main page
├── style.css           ← Your styles
├── script.js           ← Your JavaScript
├── images/             ← Your pictures
│   ├── logo.png
│   └── background.jpg
└── fonts/              ← Your fonts
    └── custom-font.ttf
```

#### **Step 4: Make It Your Own** 🏠
```bash
# Remove the old connection
git remote remove origin

# Add your own repository (replace with your details)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
```

**What this does:** Connects your project to your own GitHub account instead of the original one.

#### **Step 5: Customize Your App** 🎨
Edit the `apk-config.json` file to make your app special:

```json
{
  "appName": "My Awesome App",           ← What your app is called
  "appId": "com.mycompany.myapp",        ← Unique ID for your app
  "version": "1.0.0",                    ← Version number
  "description": "My converted web app", ← Description of your app
  "icon": {
    "enabled": true,                     ← Use custom icon
    "path": "www/icon.png"               ← Where your icon is
  },
  "splashScreen": {
    "backgroundColor": "#ffffff",         ← Background color
    "imageUrl": "www/splash.png"         ← Splash screen image
  }
}
```

**To add a custom icon:**
1. Create a 192x192 pixel PNG image
2. Name it `icon.png`
3. Put it in the `www/` folder
4. **Capacitor will automatically use this for your Android app icon**

#### **Step 6: Send It to GitHub** 🚀
```bash
# Add all your files
git add .

# Save your changes with a message
git commit -m "Add my awesome website project"

# Send it to GitHub
git push origin main
```

**What this does:** Saves your website to GitHub and starts building your app automatically!

#### **Step 7: Get Your App!** 📱
```bash
# Check if your app is ready and download it
npm run web2apk getapp
```

**What this does:** 
- 🔍 Checks if your app is ready
- ⏳ Shows live progress if it's still building
- 📥 Downloads your APK when it's ready
- 🎉 Shows success message!

```

### **Problem 2: "GitHub CLI is not authenticated"** ❌

**What you see:**
```
✖ GitHub CLI Error: GitHub CLI is not authenticated. Please run:
gh auth login
Or use: setup-gh-auth.bat
```

**Solution:** Log in to GitHub! 🔐

**Easy way:**

# 5. Copy the code and press Enter
# 6. Complete login in your browser
```

### **Problem 3: "gh command not found"** ❌

**What you see:**
```
gh : The term 'gh' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.
```

**Solution:** Restart your terminal! 🔄

**Why this happens:** When you install GitHub CLI, your current terminal doesn't know about it yet.

**Fix:**
1. **Close your terminal/command prompt completely**
2. **Open a new terminal/command prompt**
3. **Navigate back to your project:**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\HP\Desktop\MyEarningWebsites\Web2Appc
   ```
4. **Test GitHub CLI:**
   ```bash
   gh --version
   ```
5. **If it works, you're good to go!**

### **Problem 4: "Build failed"** ❌

**What you see:**
```
❌ Latest build failed
🔗 View error details: https://github.com/AshishY794/web2apk/actions
```

**Solution:** Check what went wrong! 🔍

1. **Click the link** to see the error details
2. **Common issues:**
   - Missing `index.html` file
   - Wrong file structure
   - Syntax errors in your code

**Fix:**
1. **Make sure you have `index.html` in the `www/` folder**
2. **Check your file structure:**
   ```
   www/
   ├── index.html    ← Must exist!
   ├── style.css     ← Optional
   ├── script.js     ← Optional
   └── other files   ← Optional
   ```
3. **Fix any errors in your code**
4. **Push again:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix errors"
   git push origin main
   ```

### **Problem 5: "APK not found"** ❌

**What you see:**
```
❌ APK file not found in downloaded artifacts
```

**Solution:** Wait a bit longer! ⏰

**Why this happens:** The build might still be running or just finished.

**Fix:**
1. **Wait 2-3 minutes**
2. **Try again:**
   ```bash
   npm run web2apk getapp
   ```
3. **Or check manually:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click "Actions" tab
   - Click on the latest workflow
   - Download the APK from "Artifacts" section

### **Problem 6: "Permission denied"** ❌

**What you see:**
```
Permission denied (publickey)
```

**Solution:** Use HTTPS instead of SSH! 🔑

**Fix:**
```bash
# Remove the old remote
git remote remove origin

# Add with HTTPS (easier)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push again
git push origin main
```

### **Problem 7: "File already exists"** ❌

**What you see:**
```
error extracting "app-debug.apk": The file exists.
```

**Solution:** This is actually good! Your APK was downloaded! 🎉

**What to do:**
1. **Check your `downloads/` folder**
2. **Look for the APK file**
3. **It's probably already there and ready to use!**

### **Problem 8: "Not a git repository"** ❌

**What you see:**
```
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```

**Solution:** Initialize Git! 📁

**Fix:**
```bash
# Initialize Git in your project
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Make your first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Add your remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### **Problem 9: "web2apk command not found"** ❌

**What you see:**
```
web2apk : The term 'web2apk' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.
```

**Solution:** Use the correct syntax for your system! 💻

**Fix:**
```bash
# Windows PowerShell/Command Prompt (use .\ before the command)
.\web2apk.bat

# Mac/Linux (use ./ before the command)
./web2apk.sh

# Or everyone can use npm (no .\ or ./ needed)
npm run web2apk
```

**Why this happens:** Windows PowerShell doesn't run scripts from the current directory by default for security reasons.

### **Problem 10: VS Code Terminal Issues** ❌

**What you see:**
```
The term 'web2apk' is not recognized in VS Code terminal
```

**Solution:** Use the correct command for VS Code terminal! 💻

**Fix:**
```bash
# In VS Code terminal, use:
npm run web2apk        # This always works in VS Code

# Or if you want to use the batch/shell files:
# Windows:
.\web2apk.bat

# Mac/Linux:
./web2apk.sh
```

**VS Code Terminal Tips:**
- VS Code terminal works the same as regular terminal
- Use `npm run web2apk` for the most reliable experience
- You can copy commands from the README and paste them
- VS Code will show you the current directory in the terminal prompt

### **Problem 11: "Cannot find module 'fs-extra'"** ❌

**What you see:**
```
Error: Cannot find module 'fs-extra'
```

**Solution:** Install dependencies first! 📦

**Why this happens:** The project needs to install its dependencies before running.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd web2apk

# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Then run the command
npm run web2apk
```

**Complete setup sequence:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AshishY794/web2apk.git
cd web2apk
npm install          # ← This step is IMPORTANT!
npm run web2apk
```

### **Problem 12: "Repository not found"** ❌

**What you see:**
```
remote: Repository not found.
fatal: repository 'https://github.com/username/reponame.git/' not found
```

**Solution:** The repository doesn't exist yet! 🆕

**What happens automatically:**
- ✅ The tool will try to create the repository for you
- ✅ Uses GitHub CLI to create a new public repository
- ✅ Pushes your code to the new repository
- ✅ Starts building your APK

**If automatic creation fails:**
1. **Go to GitHub:** https://github.com/new
2. **Create a new repository:**
   - Repository name: (use the name you entered)
   - Make it public
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have files)
3. **Try the command again:**
   ```bash
   npm run web2apk
   ```

**Manual fix:**
```bash
# Create repository manually on GitHub first
# Then run:
git push origin main
```

### **Problem 13: "GitHub CLI ready but 'gh' not recognized"** ❌

**What you see:**
```
✅ GitHub CLI is ready!
...
❌ Failed to create repository: Command failed: gh repo create...
'gh' is not recognized as an internal or external command
```

**Solution:** GitHub CLI detection worked, but the command path is wrong! 🔧

**What happens automatically:**
- ✅ The tool will detect the correct GitHub CLI path
- ✅ Use the full path to the GitHub CLI executable
- ✅ Show which command is being used for debugging

**If it still fails:**
1. **Check GitHub CLI installation:**
   ```bash
   # Try these commands:
   gh --version
   "C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe" --version
   ```

2. **Reinstall GitHub CLI:**
   ```bash
   # Windows:
   winget install GitHub.cli
   
   # Or download from: https://cli.github.com/
   ```

3. **Restart your terminal** after installation

**Manual workaround:**
```bash
# Create repository manually on GitHub first
# Then run:
git push origin main
```

### **Problem 14: "Repository already has files"** ❌

**What you see:**
```
⚠️  Repository already has files.
Do you want to replace all existing files? (y/n):
```

**Solution:** The repository already has files from a previous run! 🔄

**What happens automatically:**
- ✅ **Detects existing files** in the GitHub repository
- ✅ **Asks for confirmation** before replacing files
- ✅ **Force pushes** to replace all existing files
- ✅ **Preserves your choice** for future runs

**Options:**
1. **Type 'y' or 'yes'** - Replace all existing files with new ones
2. **Type 'n' or 'no'** - Keep existing files and add new ones

**What happens when you choose 'y':**
```bash
🗑️  Replacing all existing files...
Force pushing to replace all files...
✅ Successfully replaced all files in repository!
🔄 GitHub Actions is now building your APK...
```

**What happens when you choose 'n':**
```bash
📁 Keeping existing files, adding new ones...
Adding files to Git...
Committing changes...
Pushing to GitHub...
✅ Successfully pushed to GitHub!
```

**Manual control:**
```bash
# Force replace all files:
git push origin main --force

# Or keep existing files:
git push origin main
```

### **Problem 15: "Checking for existing files" takes too long** ⏰

**What you see:**
```
⠦ Checking for existing files in repository...
# Hangs for a long time
```

**Solution:** Network timeout or repository access issue! 🌐

**What happens automatically:**
- ✅ **10-second timeout** added to prevent hanging
- ✅ **Continues with normal push** if timeout occurs
- ✅ **Shows helpful message** about proceeding

**If it still hangs:**
1. **Check your internet connection**
2. **Try again** - it might be a temporary network issue
3. **Use manual method** below

**Manual fix:**
```bash
# Skip the check and push directly:
git add .
git commit -m "Update website files"
git push origin main --force
```

### **Problem 16: "Unable to add remote 'origin'"** ❌

**What you see:**
```
❌ Failed to create repository: Command failed: gh repo create...
X Unable to add remote "origin"
```

**Solution:** Remote origin conflict! 🔧

**What happens automatically:**
- ✅ **Removes existing remote** before creating repository
- ✅ **Tries alternative method** if first attempt fails
- ✅ **Creates repository step by step** to avoid conflicts

**Alternative methods:**
1. **Automatic fallback** - Tool tries different creation methods
2. **Manual creation** - Create repository on GitHub.com first
3. **Clean start** - Remove existing git remote manually

**Manual fix:**
```bash
# Remove existing remote:
git remote remove origin

# Create repository manually on GitHub.com
# Then add remote and push:
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/reponame.git
git push origin main
```

   ```
   www/
   └── splash.png  ← Your splash screen (for Capacitor)
   ```

3. **Capacitor automatically:**
   - Creates native Android splash screen resources
   - Generates splash screens for different orientations
   - Shows your splash screen when the app starts

3. **Update your config:**
   ```json
   {
     "splashScreen": {
       "backgroundColor": "#ffffff",
       "imageUrl": "www/splash.png"

### **What is Capacitor?** 🤔

Capacitor is like a bridge between your website and mobile apps. It takes your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and makes it work like a native app on phones and tablets.

**Think of it like this:**
- Your website = A book
- Capacitor = A magic book cover
- The result = A book that works like an app!

**How Capacitor Uses Your Files:**
- **`icon.png`** → Creates native Android app icons
- **`splash.png`** → Creates native Android splash screens
- **`index.html`** → Becomes your app's main screen
- **CSS/JS files** → Work exactly like in a browser

### **What is GitHub Actions?** 🤖

GitHub Actions is like having a robot assistant that:
- Watches your code
- Builds your app when you make changes
- Saves the result for you
- Works 24/7 without you doing anything!

### **What is an APK?** 📱

APK stands for "Android Package Kit". It's like a box that contains your app. When you install it on an Android device, it becomes a real app that you can use!

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### **Creating Release Versions** 🏷️

To create a professional release:

1. **Create a version tag:**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions automatically:**
   - Builds a signed release APK
   - Creates a GitHub release
   - Attaches the APK for download

### **Customizing Workflows** ⚙️

You can modify the build process by editing:
- `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml` - Debug APK builds
